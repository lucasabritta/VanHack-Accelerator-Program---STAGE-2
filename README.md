# VanHack-Accelerator-Program---STAGE-2
This project is for a fullstack / backend

As a fullstack / backend developer I have to do:

Develop a simple Forum app with:

  1. Landing page with all Posts;
  2. Post's category;
  3. Commenting system;
  4. Login/Logout with permission to edit only owned Posts/Comments;

For this task I implemented a solution using:

  1. PHP
  2. JavaScript
  3. mySQL
  4. HTML
  5. CSS
  
#TODO

1. more security
2. better UI
3. limit of post/commentary per page
